# Late-Time-Cosmology-Of-Scalar-Tensor-Theories
Dedicated for evaluating various statefinders and comparing results with ΛCDM model:

The available Mathematica code serves as a tool in order to study the late-time era for a modified gravity model. As a general model, an f(R,φ) gravity was chosen
along with a canonical scalar field and a non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. As a model, we study the case 
of an f(R) gravity with only a kinetic term for the potential, which can be found in the two available arXiv papers present in the code. The user is capable of studying 
a plethora of scalar-tensor models in a compact way. Moreover, the aforementioned code contains useful intermediate steps that explain how and what is evaluated in each
consequtive step. Finally, after evaluations have been carried away, a comparison between the extracted results and the ΛCDM model is perfomed in order to ascertain 
the validity of the respective model. One can find the available arXiv paper reffering to Planck data. The code is obviously available for distribution.
